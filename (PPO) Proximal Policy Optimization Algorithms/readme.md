# Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (PPO)
This folder contains the implementation of paper entitled "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms" ("https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf").
This contribution of this paper is about using (Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (PPO)) in problems of HIGH-DIMENSIONAL CONTINUOUS CONTROL (problems that require continious control through all the episode).
